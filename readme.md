# About

This project focuses on analyzing the 120 years of Olympics history dataset using SQL queries. The dataset consists of two tables: "dataset_olympics.csv" and "noc_region.csv". The "dataset_olympics" table contains information about athletes, their teams, the Olympic Games they participated in, and the medals they won. The "noc_region" table provides the mapping between the National Olympic Committee codes (NOC) and the corresponding regions. By cleaning the dataset using Python and Pandas, the project aims to ensure data quality. To extract insights based on the questions given, SQL queries will be written in module 2.
